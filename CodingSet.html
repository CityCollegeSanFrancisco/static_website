<p class="p1">During a meeting in June, we took a break from the code/GitHub/what-are-we-even-doing-here talk and played a game of Set. Set is a game where there are 12 cards, each with 1 of 3 numbers, fills, colors, and shapes. The goal is to find 3 cards where the each attribute is either all the same, or all different. (read Andy Ly’s SetPost for a more in depth explanation of Set). While leaving Philz, we decided that it would be pretty simple to code, that was until 3am the next morning.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I knew I had to create the 12 cards, but that was as simple as creating 12, 4 element arrays and randomizing each element from 0-2 (each element defining a different card attribute). I then had to figure out how I would compare each card and find all of the sets. I knew I had to compare the same element from 3 different cards and see if they were either all the same or all different. Later I realized that if 2 cards had the same attribute, but 3rd card didn’t, it could not be a set. This seemed like a super simple way to compare them. After a little bit of testing I realized it was gonna take me a lot longer then I had anticipated. For each attribute I had to write an if statement comparing each card multiple times. It ended up being 4 very long if statements but I got it to work in the end.</p>
