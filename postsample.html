    Descrabbling the Data
    </h1>

    <h2>
    So after our Scrabble game we had a text file with hand-entered records of our each play like this:
  </h2>

    <code>6:26pm James: Maze (15 pts)<br>6:26pm Zach: Zest (15 pts)<br>...
    </code>

    <p>Sure we could just make a table by hand and count up all the points. But we have a lot more interesting info here: the words played, how many words per play, how long each play took, and others I can’t even figure out.</p>

    <p>How could we process this text file to total up the scores and tell us other interesting things?</p>

    <img src="imgs/scrabble.png">

    <p>I decided to use the Python I learned in CS 131A to write a program that analyzes the text. </p>

    <p>At first I thought it would be easy to just read each line and connect the scores with each of our names. But then I realized it would be more useful to have a program that worked with *any* name. </p>

    <p>So I made a dictionary of players that would have the players names as keys and data about the players as the values. </p>

    <iframe height="800px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@swill123/ScrabbleScores?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

    <p>I split each line of the file into a list and then I used regular expressions to pull out the players names and put them into the dictionary and then to pull out the scores and put them in a list for each player.</p>

    <p>This regex was challenging because of the (intentional?) human error that I had to work around, like when there were spaces or other delimiters missing or duplicated. Testing on Regex101.com really helped.</p>

    <p>I’d like to do more analysis of the words played, like to check against a dictionary to tell how obscure the word is. I think I need to learn more about Scrabble first though!</p>
